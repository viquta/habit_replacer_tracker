# Conception Phase

## Overview

This phase represents the most important part of the design process. Anything that is overlooked or forgotten in this phase has a negative effect on the implementation later and will lead, in the worst case, to useless results.

### Key Considerations

- **Technical Foundation**: There's no need to go into too much detail about what habits are etc., you can directly dive into the proposed solution
- **Architecture Design**: Apart from your `Habit` class do you need anything else? 
- **Data Management**: How does habit data get stored and retrieved? 
- **User Experience**: How do users interact with the application and what's the general user flow of your app? 

### Documentation Requirements

To help visualizing your concept, at least one diagram (e.g., in UML) will be created and inserted to the written concept to show the interaction of the components and the process.

## Design Process Importance

This step of creating a concept first is perhaps the most important of the entire design process. It is crucial to take/plan enough time for this phase before the next steps can be taken. It is therefore essential to follow the sequence of the respective steps carefully.

## Development Considerations

It is important not only to consider what the client probably expects from your habit tracking app, but also how users should interact with it, how they create new habits, complete tasks, and check for their progress. The written concept must explain why the structure and process have been designed in the particular manner. Think about which tools you can use to implement each component and the communication between the components.

## Submission Requirements

### Deliverables

- **Format**: A conceptual text (1-3 DIN A4 pages) as PDF has to be prepared for the submission
- **Content**: Explaining these analyses and considerations, together with the diagram(s) showing the interaction of the components and the process
- **Submission**: The PDF will be uploaded in the PebblePad template, the text field in the template can be left empty

### Support and Feedback

Throughout the process, online tutorials are offered, and they provide an opportunity to talk, share ideas and/or drafts, and obtain feedback. In the online tutorials, exemplary work can be discussed with the tutor. Here, everyone has the opportunity to get involved and learn from each other's feedback. 

### Best Practices

It is recommended to make use of these channels to avoid errors and to make improvements. You should only submit work after making use of the above-mentioned tutorial and informative media. This will be followed by a feedback from the tutor and the work on the second phase can begin.
