# Conception Phase

## Overview

This phase represents the most important part of the design process. Anything that is overlooked or forgotten in this phase has a negative effect on the implementation later and will lead, in the worst case, to useless results.

### Key Considerations

- **Technical Foundation**: There's no need to go into too much detail about what habits are etc., I can directly dive into the proposed solution
- **Architecture Design**: Apart from my `Habit` class do I need anything else? 
- **Data Management**: How does habit data get stored and retrieved? 
- **User Experience**: How do users interact with the application and what's the general user flow of my app? 

### Documentation Requirements

At least one diagram (e.g., in UML or C4) will be created and inserted to the written concept to show the interaction of the components and the process.


## Development Considerations

How they (clients) create new habits, complete tasks, and check for their progress. The written concept must explain why the structure and process have been designed in the particular manner. What tools can I use to implement each component and the communication between the components.

## Submission Requirements

### Deliverables

- **Format**: A conceptual text (1-3 DIN A4 pages) as PDF has to be prepared for the submission
- **Content**: Explaining these analyses and considerations, together with the diagram(s) showing the interaction of the components and the process
- **Submission**: The PDF will be uploaded in the PebblePad template, the text field in the template can be left empty
