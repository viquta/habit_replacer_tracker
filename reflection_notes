Notes:

31 July:
  focusing on CLI with dummy components 
  instaling "rich" from pip
  CLI complete (with dummy components)
  setting up MS SQL Server Express on Docker (since I'm currently developing on Mac)
  
  
  Some notes for performance:
    "Performance Guidance
    
    T-SQL will likely be faster for your habit tracking queries because:
    
    Data proximity - Processing happens where the data lives (database server)
    Optimized execution - SQL Server's query optimizer is highly sophisticated
    Reduced data transfer - Only results are sent over the network, not raw data
    Indexing benefits - Your indexes (IX_HabitCompletions_HabitID, IX_HabitCompletions_CompletionDate) directly support query performance
    Python might be better for:
    
    Complex statistical analysis beyond SQL's capabilities
    Data visualization
    Machine learning algorithms
    Custom business logic that's difficult to express in SQL"

  I should build with python:
    CLI Interface & User Experience (check)
    Smart Analytics & Recommendations
    Pattern Recognition & Insights
    Personalized Coaching Logic
    Data Export & Reporting
    Intelligent Habit Suggestions

  I should use sql for:
    basic aggregations (completion rates)
    Current/longest streaks
