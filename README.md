# Habit Tracker Application

A Python-based CLI habit tracking application with database integration, designed to help users track and replace bad habits with good ones.

## üåü Project Philosophy

**"Assume the user is performing the habit unless they log that they have not performed the routine."**

This application follows a positive reinforcement approach, making it smooth and encouraging for users to maintain their habits.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**For the impatient** - Get up and running in a few minutes:

1. **Prerequisites**: Windows + SQL Server Express + ODBC Driver 17 + Python 3.8+
2. **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/viquta/habit_replacer_tracker.git` and `cd habit_replacer_tracker`
3. **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Database**: Create `HabitTrackerDB` in SQL Server (SSMS or sqlcmd), then run:
   ```powershell
   python backend_and_DB_setup/mssql-express/scripts/setup_db.py
   ```
6. **Launch**: `python CLI.py`

   # Open Services (services.msc) and ensure these are running:
   # - SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)
   # - SQL Server Browser
   ```

2. **Verify Database Exists**:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio
   - Connect to `localhost\SQLEXPRESS`
   - Check if `HabitTrackerDB` database exists

3. **Check Instance Name**:
   - Default should be `SQLEXPRESS`
   - If different, update connection strings in backend configuration

#### Python Import Errors

**Error**: `‚ö†Ô∏è Backend not available: ImportError`

**Solutions**:
1. **Install Dependencies**:
